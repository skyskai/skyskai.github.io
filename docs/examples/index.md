# Examples Overview

This section provides practical examples of using the ABAP ADT API library. It covers various use cases from basic to advanced examples.

## Basic Examples

On the [Basic Examples](./basic.md) page, you can find examples for the following basic operations:

- Login and session management
- Object structure exploration
- Source code retrieval and modification
- Syntax checking and activation
- Code analysis and completion

## Advanced Examples

On the [Advanced Examples](./advanced.md) page, you can find examples for the following advanced operations:

- Transport management automation
- ABAP Git repository synchronization
- Unit testing automation
- Code quality analysis (ATC)
- Performance tracing and analysis
- Debugging automation
- Bulk change processing

## Exploring Examples

Each example is structured as follows:

1. **Purpose**: Description of the example's purpose and the problem it aims to solve
2. **Setup**: Required setup and prerequisites
3. **Code**: Example code with explanations
4. **Execution**: How to run the code and expected results
5. **Extension**: Suggestions for extending or customizing the example

## How to Run Examples

To run the examples, you will need:

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Valid access rights to an SAP system
3. The abap-adt-api library installed

### Installation Method

```bash
# Create a new project directory
mkdir abap-adt-examples
cd abap-adt-examples

# Initialize npm project
npm init -y

# Install abap-adt-api and required packages
npm install abap-adt-api typescript ts-node

# Create TypeScript configuration file
npx tsc --init
```

### Running Example Files

```bash
# Run TypeScript example
npx ts-node example-file.ts
```

## Example Configuration File

For most examples, it's recommended to use a configuration file that includes system connection information. This allows you to reuse the same connection information across multiple examples.

Here's the basic structure of a `config.ts` file:

```typescript
// config.ts
export const SAP_CONFIG = {
  server: 'https://your-sap-server.com',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  client: '001',  // Optional
  language: 'EN'  // Optional
};

// Configuration for development, test, and production systems
export const SYSTEMS = {
  dev: {
    ...SAP_CONFIG,
    server: 'https://dev-sap-server.com'
  },
  test: {
    ...SAP_CONFIG,
    server: 'https://test-sap-server.com'
  },
  prod: {
    ...SAP_CONFIG,
    server: 'https://prod-sap-server.com'
  }
};

// Frequently used packages and objects
export const COMMON_OBJECTS = {
  mainPackage: 'ZEXAMPLE_PKG',
  mainProgram: 'ZEXAMPLE_PROGRAM',
  mainClass: 'ZCL_EXAMPLE_CLASS',
  transportRequests: {
    dev: 'DEVK900123',
    test: 'TESTK900456'
  }
};
```

## How to Contribute Examples

To contribute your own examples or improve existing ones, submit a pull request (PR) to the GitHub repository.

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Write a new example or modify an existing one.
3. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
4. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

Follow these guidelines when writing examples:

- Clear documentation: Clearly explain the purpose and how to use it
- Follow best practices: Error handling, resource cleanup, etc.
- Real-world use cases: Solve problems that occur in actual work
- Reusability: Write in a way that can be used in various environments
